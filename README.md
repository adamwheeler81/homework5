AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

This is a functional Day Planner application.
The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).
Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.
Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.
The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.
